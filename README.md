Project 1
## Overview:
This repository will be for planning the semester and what needs to be done. Also, a structure will be added on how and when each project is completed as well as a brief explanation on what branching strategy I will be using.
## Project Structure:
I will be using a separate repository for each project. This will help with keeping it clean and organized. 
The projects are as follows:
### Project 1: Agile & Scrum

### Project 3: Web App Project Testing Patterns
### Project 4: RPA & Testing Project
### Project 5: Reporting Project
